A/B Testing &amp; Regression Analysis on Marketing Campaigns: Analyzing Facebook and AdWords ad performance to determine the most cost-effective platform using statistical methods and machine learning.

Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of two marketing campaigns (Facebook Ads vs. AdWords) using A/B testing and regression analysis. The goal is to determine which platform provides better click-through rates (CTR), conversion rates, and overall cost-effectiveness.

Business Problem

As a marketing agency, maximizing return on investment (ROI) for ad campaigns is crucial. By comparing Facebook and AdWords campaigns, we aim to identify the better-performing platform for cost-efficient conversions.

Research Question

Which platform is more effective in terms of conversions, clicks, and cost-effectiveness?

Dataset Description

The dataset includes 365 rows (one per day in 2019) with the following features:

Date: Campaign data for each day of the year 2019.

Ad Views: Number of times the ad was displayed.

Ad Clicks: Number of clicks received.

Ad Conversions: Number of conversions generated.

Cost per Ad: The cost of running the campaign.

Click-Through Rate (CTR): Clicks/Views ratio.

Conversion Rate: Conversions/Clicks ratio.

Cost per Click (CPC): Average cost per click.

Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Histograms to compare ad performance.

Checking distribution of clicks, conversions, and cost metrics.

A/B Testing

Null Hypothesis (H₀): No significant difference between Facebook and AdWords campaigns.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Significant difference exists.

Using statistical tests to determine the better campaign.

Regression Analysis

Identifying key factors that drive ad conversions.

Determining correlations between ad views, clicks, and costs.

Key Findings

The histograms suggest a symmetrical distribution, meaning ad performance is generally stable across both platforms.

The statistical tests reveal whether one platform is superior.

Regression analysis identifies which features contribute most to successful conversions.
